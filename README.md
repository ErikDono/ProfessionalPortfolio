# ProfessionalPortfolio
This will be an updated portfolio page (WIP). I will be continuously changing this page, so please keep checking back for updates :)

my portfolio is now dynamic, but I can see how to make it even more usable. The Javascript allows the html to all stay on one page, and every link opens in a separate tab. This allows you to easily come back, if you need to access more info. 

Here is a breakdown of my pages:


-       Main Page 
My main page is my mission statement. Admittedly, this could be more eye-catching, and could use the logo that I made. For now, this page will serve as a holder for some basic text about what I plan on doing, and why.

- - limitations:  Resizing Iphone and Ipad

While the text is not broken on ipad and iphone, the background had a gap on the Ipad setting, see below.

Also, when resizing the page, the header overtakes a large portion of the text. This is true of all pages. 
        
-       Portfolio Page  

The portfolio page itself has snapshots of two applications and my project. The image itself is a link to the application, while the text in front is a link to the git hub repo for the project. I look forward to putting more items on here!

- - Limitations: Resizing Iphone and Ipad

The text for the github stays ontop of the image, but the images do not resize. This causes the page to look a bit choppy.

-       About Me Page

My ‘About Me’ page is a snippet about my life (which needs to be updated), as well as a copy of my resume. The link sits ontop of my picture, as to stay uniform.

- - Limitations: Resizing and orginization 

First, I do not think I should have kept it uniform with the other photos. Changing it from an About Me to a Professional Resource page, or something simmilar, may be a better idea.

- Contact Me 

This page is a relic from my preivous portfolio, but i want to include it. eventually, i would like to have a space where people can write a message to me. i know that it would take me taking the values of the inputs, and having the button create a 'mailto' with the strings (i may have to make them into objects like we just learned?) . I would like to make the button create a modal, however.

- Personal Links

I could not sleep without doing this on a seperate page. it needed to be done...
